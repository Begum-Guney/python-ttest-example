# ttest_interpretation

This notebook demonstrates how to perform an independent t-test in Python using basic simulated data.  
The focus is not only on calculating the result, but also on understanding and interpreting key statistical outputs such as:

- p-value  
- t-statistic  
- confidence interval  
- effect size (Cohen's d)  
- and power analysis

Additionally, it includes a seaborn-based visualization to compare group conversion rates.

## ðŸ§ª Goal

To learn how to apply a t-test using Python and to interpret the results clearly and correctly.

---

## ðŸ§° Libraries Used

- `numpy` â€” data simulation and math  
- `pandas` â€” data wrangling  
- `scipy.stats` â€” t-test  
- `statsmodels` â€” confidence intervals, power analysis  
- `seaborn` & `matplotlib` â€” visualization

## ðŸ’¬ Notes

- The dataset is fully simulated.

# ttest_interpretation

This notebook demonstrates how to perform an independent t-test in Python using basic simulated data.  
The focus is not only on calculating the test, but also on understanding the result step by step.

---

## ðŸ§ª Goal

To learn how to apply a t-test using Python and to interpret the outcome through code and commentary.

---

## ðŸ“„ Whatâ€™s Inside

- Simulated A/B testing data
- Group-wise statistics
- Independent t-test
- 95% confidence interval
- Seaborn-based visualization

ðŸ’¬ Interpretation of each statistical output is included directly within the Colab notebook.

## ðŸ§° Libraries Used

- `numpy` â€” data simulation  
- `pandas` â€” data wrangling  
- `scipy.stats` â€” t-test  
- `statsmodels` â€” confidence interval  
- `seaborn`, `matplotlib` â€” data visualization

---

## ðŸ’¬ Notes

- The dataset is entirely simulated.
